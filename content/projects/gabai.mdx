gabAI is a project-consultant matching web app that employs Natural Language Processing to interpret and process user preferences, field of interests, and specific requirements with high accuracy. 

Instead of looking for an ***Otorhinolaryngologist***, you can skip the tongue twister and just say ***"My throat hurts"*** and it automatically searches for ENT physicians.


Completed the project in an AI hackathon, within an intense 3-day timeframe. Built with TypeScript, Next.JS, TailwindCSS, Python, and Django.
